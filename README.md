# Pitchfork Reviews

Himanshi &amp; Jose 

Final project for Intro to Data Science Class

We look at Pitchfork reviews from 2000-2016 to answer one basic question: how does language differ across good and bad reviews? 


This repository has three sections.

In the scripts sections you can find the R scripts to generate the images and tables. It also contains the script that gets the data from SQLite database and merges it into a single data frame (Gets_data.rmd) and the script that then modifies the data to get the dataframe used in all further analyses (Modify_Data.rmd). 

In the data section you can find the merged dataframe ("Pitchfork.csv") and the modified version we use for the analysis ("Pitchfork_modified.csv"). 

In the Figures section you can find files for all the plots and tables included in the report.
