# Pitchfork Reviews

Himanshi &amp; Jose 

Final project for Intro to Data Science Class

We look at Pitchfork reviews from 2000-2016 to answer one basic question: how does language differ across good and bad reviews? 


This repository has three sections.

In the **Scripts** sections you can find the R scripts to generate the images and tables used in throughout the analysis. It also contains the script that gets the data from SQLite database and merges it into a single table ("Gets_data.rmd"). You can also find the script that then modifies the data to get the dataframe used in all further analyses ("Modify_Data.rmd"). Note, if you want to run "Gets_data.rmd" you first need to access the download the data provided by Nolan Conway here: https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data


In the **Data** section you can find the merged dataframe ("Pitchfork.csv") and the modified version we use for the analysis ("Pitchfork_modified.csv"). 

In the **Figures** section you can find files for all the plots and tables included in the report.
